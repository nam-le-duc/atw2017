            description: "<p>During the year 2015 - 2016 I was hired to coach the IT centre of a state-owned insurance company to adopt Agile. Due to the heavily mutual dependent infrastructure, coaching a small team to adopt Agile (Scrum, Kanban, or whatever) doesn't make sense, so I chose to pull multiple teams into the transformation freeway.</p><p>People are very political in state-owned enterprises, and they don't have strong willingness to adopt new things, therefore it's extremely risky injecting Scrum or any Agile framework as a whole into the teams. I designed the transformation roadmap as:<ol><li>How to pull a leg (single team);</li><li>How to pull four legs (multiple product teams) to move;</li><li>How to pull the whole of the elephant (the IT centre);</li><li>How to move gracefully (using Design Thinking to improve User eXperience);</li><li>How to move stably (make Agile part of the organization culture).</li></ol></p><p>The transformation was in general a success (achieved both the expectation of the client and me). I summarize 5 tips in how to change a organization, which are good supplementaries to Lean-Agile scaling principles in implementing Agile transformation in scale.</p><p>In this 45-minutes talk I will share how I achieved the goals in the roadmap, the challenges and lessons learnt, and how to use the 5 tips to make your Agile journey easier and better.</p>"

        description	: "Adopting agile can cause quite a lot of turmoil depending on how organisations are setup. It’s something some experts in cultural transformation call Liminality, the quality of ambiguity or disorientation that happens in the middle stage of a ritual. This process, as we know, causes fear, panic, depression and even some some neuroses. As Agile Coaches, we want to help everyone transition this phase without much of those issues, so we need to understand what causes liminality and how to make it work for us."
