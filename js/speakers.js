        description: "<p>During the year 2015 - 2016 I was hired to coach the IT centre of a state-owned insurance company to adopt Agile. Due to the heavily mutual dependent infrastructure, coaching a small team to adopt Agile (Scrum, Kanban, or whatever) doesn't make sense, so I chose to pull multiple teams into the transformation freeway.</p><p>People are very political in state-owned enterprises, and they don't have strong willingness to adopt new things, therefore it's extremely risky injecting Scrum or any Agile framework as a whole into the teams. I designed the transformation roadmap as:<ol><li>How to pull a leg (single team);</li><li>How to pull four legs (multiple product teams) to move;</li><li>How to pull the whole of the elephant (the IT centre);</li><li>How to move gracefully (using Design Thinking to improve User eXperience);</li><li>How to move stably (make Agile part of the organization culture).</li></ol></p><p>The transformation was in general a success (achieved both the expectation of the client and me). I summarize 5 tips in how to change a organization, which are good supplementaries to Lean-Agile scaling principles in implementing Agile transformation in scale.</p><p>In this 45-minutes talk I will share how I achieved the goals in the roadmap, the challenges and lessons learnt, and how to use the 5 tips to make your Agile journey easier and better.</p>"

        description	: "<ol><li>According to the research \“Conditions for Self-Organizing in Human Systems\” done by Glenda H. Eoyang, container, difference, and exchange are the conditions that shape the path of the self-organizing processes. Self-organizing is the process that moves from one state of coherence to another.<br>The CDE Model provides a simple and generalizable framework to describe the emergent behavior of human collectives.</li><li>Self-Organizing team lives in an environment, interacts with the environment. contextual support for self-organising teams consists basically of four sub-systems:<ul>information – in terms of providing teams the data that members need to competently plan and execute their work</ul><ul>infrastructure – in terms of appropriate physical space (a factor many co-located teams struggle with), technical infrastructure and money.</ul><ul>education – in terms of any training, coaching or technical assistance the team may need</ul><ul>reward – in terms of providing positive, economic as well as symbolic consequences for good team performance.</ul>As a leader or manager, you could cultivate the team by changing those sub-systems over the time.</li><li>The most important factor for a Self-Organizing team, is to have a compelling mission or vision. Once the team has the authority to set their goal and decide how to process towards the goal, with some support, Self-Organizing is just a \"by-product\" of actualizing the goal.</li></ol>"
